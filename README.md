# Barry Tarlton's Grocery Store POS kata submission

This was coded using [SpringBoot 2.0.3](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and on [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

I'm using [Maven 3.X](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for my build/packaging tool.

To run the tests simply run the "**mvn test**" command.

To actually run the application run "**mvn spring-boot:run**"

By default it will listen on port 8080.

I've added a PostMan collection if you wish to test it actually running.

I've also created a Swagger/Open API Spec on SwaggerHub for what I've completed so far.

The OAS/Swagger can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/btarlton/grocery-store_kata_api/1.0.0#/)
